						<p>
							<b>Introsception</b> is a tool that allows you to redefine the meaning of your life. Introspect meaning to look within and inception to suggest yourself new ideas. <b>Introsception</b> allows you to recreate the images you have about different areas of your life and give them a new meaning. According to Cognitive Neuroscience your brain is a prediction engine. It predicts what you see and hear even before you process the information. Which means we indeed are the sum of our thoughts. Our brains, however hate prediction errors so anytime what we experience is different from what we were expecting, this leads towards cognitive distortions and we start feeling anxious and depressed. And then we spend our entire lives feeling powerless and frustrated simply because we don’t understand how our brains work and process information. To escape we take drugs, pills and form all sorts of negative habits in order to find a solution to not feel this way.

					<h3 style="font-style:normal;font-weight:800;font-size:24px;">Journalling</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Journalling</b> for centuries has been a great tool to ponder over our thoughts and figure out patterns from within our mind. Most journalling tools such as notebooks or apps are either too simplistic or make it very difficult to organise our thoughts and recall them whenever we want. And this leads towards frustration and is not good for staying consistent. 
					</p>
					<p style="color: #00A3FF;font-weight:bold;font-size:24px;">And so in order to create the perfect journalling tool we decided to create INTROSPECTION.</p>

					<h2>Thought Networks to help you find the patterns within your mind.</h2>
					<h3>INTROSPECTION, allows you to create thought networks which are nodes similar to the human brain that you can connect together to find the hidden patterns behind your thoughts. 
					</h3>
					<p>
						These nodes unlike a simple diary are powered by voice language understanding. That means anytime you want to recall your thoughts you simply have to speak the keywords and the neural network powering these nodes will provide you with all the thoughts you have written down regarding a certain keyword or topic. Creating these thought networks is as simple as using Notepad.

					<h2>Memory Networks help you relive your past memories and emotions in order to help you better understand yourself.</h2>
					<h3>INTROSPECTION, also allows you to create memory networks which work similar to thought networks.</h3>
					<p>
						However, these nodes can process and understand videos and images, which means you can create a time machine of different memories and also make them respond to emotions and sentiment in order to help you visually recollect how each event of your life made you feel and the lessons that you learned or could learn from them. Creating these memory networks is as simple as uploading and tagging pictures on Instagram.
